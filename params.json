{"name":"SAMOA","tagline":"Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis","body":"SAMOA is a platform for mining on big data streams.\r\nIt is a distributed streaming machine learning (ML) framework that contains a \r\nprograming abstraction for distributed streaming ML algorithms.\r\n\r\nSAMOA enables development of new ML algorithms without dealing with \r\nthe complexity of underlying streaming processing engines (SPE, such \r\nas Apache Storm and Apache S4). SAMOA also provides extensibility in integrating\r\nnew SPEs into the framework. These features allow SAMOA users to develop \r\ndistributed streaming ML algorithms once and to execute the algorithms \r\nin multiple SPEs, i.e., code the algorithms once and execute them in multiple SPEs.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\n###Storm\r\n\r\nSimply clone the repository and install SAMOA.\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git@github.com:yahoo/samoa.git\r\ncd samoa\r\nmvn -Pstorm package\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe deployable jar for SAMOA will be in `target/SAMOA-Storm-0.0.1.jar`.\r\n\r\n###S4\r\n\r\nIf you want to compile SAMOA for S4, you will need to install the S4 dependencies\r\nmanually as explained in [Executing SAMOA with Apache S4](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Executing-SAMOA-with-Apache-S4).\r\n\r\nOnce the dependencies if needed are installed, you can simply clone the repository and install SAMOA.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git@github.com:yahoo/samoa.git\r\ncd samoa\r\nmvn -Ps4 package\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe deployable jars for SAMOA will be in `target/SAMOA-S4-0.0.1.jar`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation is intended to give an introduction on how to use SAMOA in the various different ways possible. \r\nAs a user you can use it to develop new algorithms and test different Stream Processing Engines.\r\n\r\n* [1 Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis)\r\n    * [1.0 Building SAMOA](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Building SAMOA)\r\n    * [1.1 Executing SAMOA with Apache Storm](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Executing SAMOA with Apache Storm)\r\n    * [1.2 Executing SAMOA with Apache S4](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Executing-SAMOA-with-Apache-S4)\r\n* [2 SAMOA and Machine Learning](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/SAMOA and Machine Learning)\r\n    * [2.1 Prequential Evaluation Task](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Prequential Evaluation Task)\r\n    * [2.2 Vertical Hoeffding Tree Classifier](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Vertical Hoeffding Tree Classifier)\r\n    * [2.3 Distributed Stream Clustering](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Distributed Stream Clustering)\r\n* [3 SAMOA Topology](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/SAMOA Topology)\r\n    * [3.1 Processor](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Processor)\r\n    * [3.2 Content Event](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Content Event)\r\n    * [3.3 Stream](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Stream)\r\n    * [3.4 Task](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Task)\r\n    * [3.5 Topology Builder](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Topology Builder)\r\n    * [3.6 Topology Starter](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Topology Starter)\r\n    * [3.7 Learner](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Learner)\r\n    * [3.8 Processing Item](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Processing Item)\r\n* [4 Developing New Tasks in SAMOA](https://github.com/yahoo/samoa/wiki/Developing New Tasks in SAMOA)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe use and distribution terms for this software are covered by the\r\nApache License, Version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
